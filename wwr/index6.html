                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Gabriel Lima, a passionate and dedicated student pursuing Software Development at BYU IDAHO. My journey in academia has been marked by a strong commitment to learning and a curiosity that drives me to explore various aspects of Brazil.</p>
    
                    <p>My academic journey still going on by hands-on experiences and extracurricular activities. I actively engage in Front-end to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. These experiences have not only enhanced my practical skills but also shaped my holistic approach to problem-solving.</p>
    
                    <p>Driven by a desire for continuous improvement, I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether it's through Web Development, I am committed to staying at the forefront of emerging trends in Brazil.</p>
    
                    <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying with my family. These activities provide me with a well-rounded perspective and contribute to my ability to adapt to diverse environments.</p>
    
                    <p>I am excited about the prospect of future goals or aspirations, such as pursuing advanced studies, entering a specific industry, or contributing to a particular field. My academic and extracurricular experiences have equipped me with the skills and mindset needed to make meaningful contributions to Brazil. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead on my educational journey.</p>

                <p>I had the privilege of working on a project for a law student's website. The project involved creating a dynamic and informative platform tailored to showcase the student's achievements, legal expertise, and academic journey.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Interactive Portfolio: Showcasing notable achievements, legal projects, and academic accomplishments.</li>
                    <li>Case Studies: Providing in-depth analyses of legal cases the student has worked on.</li>
