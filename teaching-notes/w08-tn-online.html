      <h1>Week 08 - Creating Wireframes</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week will be very design-focused. The students will chose a child page that they would like to
          complete for the Rafting Site. This week they will apply basic design principles by producing a wireframe for
          that rafting page.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Students get confused that they are creating a wireframe for the rafting site and not the personal site.
          Make sure they know that the wireframe they create this week is for the second page of the rafting site, not
          the personal site.</li>
        <li>Students will continue working on their personal site plans as well. They will be gathering content for
          their personal site.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>W08 Assignment: Web Challenge</h3>
        <li>This week, students are not recreating a web page but instead optimizing an image. The purpose for this web challenge is to help them remember how to optimize images because they will need to optimize all their new personal site images.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W08 Wireframes</h3>
        <li>This is simply videos, for students to watch, explaining wireframes and how they can go about creating them.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W08 Assignment: Rafting site Subpage Wireframe</h3>
        <li>Students will create a wireframe of the second rafting page. They can use the provided content and images or come up with their own.</li>
        <li>It is really important that they follow good design principles. Many students have a hard time with things like symmetry and white space. Their wireframes need to follow these design principles.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W08 Assignment: Personal Site Content</h3>
        <li>Encourage the students to take the content creation activity for their personal sites seriously. It is
          really hard to design and create a site with no content!</li>
        <li>They may be confused about why they are placing content in their site plan. This is to give them a head start when it comes to creating their pages when they get to HTML. They can copy and paste the text and image tags from their site plan. It is also always good practice to know your content before coding. SEO is all about content and they should know how important content is.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course Questions and Conversations Discussion Board.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
