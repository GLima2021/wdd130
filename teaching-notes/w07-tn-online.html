      <h1>Week 07 - Finishing the Home Page</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week students will apply the layout skills they learned last week to finish up the Home page for the
          whitewater rafting site.</li>
        <li>Students will also begin a site plan for their personal sites. They will use a new folder in Git and GitHub for
          this. This will also involve a bit of extra attention on the student's part as well, to make sure they get the
          correct URL submitted for each assignment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>W07 Assignment: Grid Alignment</h3>
        <li>The 'Grid Alignment' activity goes over aligning children of the grid and the grid itself. There are a few
          alignments they will need for the rafting home page.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W07 Assignment: Home Page Finishing Touches</h3>
        <li>Students will layout their home page with grid this week. It is helpful to let them know to place all the children before they get too worried about how the page looks on live server.</li>
        <li>The media query is introduced with this assignment, but the students can simply copy and past the media query. It might be
          helpful to talk more about media queries with students if they are confused about how it works.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W07 Assignment: Personal Site Plan</h3>
        <li>Students will begin their site plan for their own personal sites this week. They should be familiar with the code provided since it's very similar to the rafting site plan.</li>
        <li>Students will be including the purpose and audience of the site, the logo, and the fonts and colors.</li>
        <li>The rest of the site plan will be completed in the next few weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span>
          <span> Discussion Board.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Remind the students of the different type of grading for the new personal site assignments. Many are
          Incomplete/Complete-- all or nothing. This is so they are encouraged to get them all right before going on.
          They can resubmit an Incomplete and have it changed to a Complete if needed.</li>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
