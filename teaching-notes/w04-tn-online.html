      <h1>Week 04 - Adding CSS</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may need to invest some extra time assisting students this week as this is the first time that many of
          them will be using CSS.</li>
          <li>
            Even if some 'Ponder' assignment are not graded, encourage the students to carefully complete them. They will need the skills covered for 'Prove' assignments.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week, the students begin styling their homepages with CSS. Remind the students again that at the end of
          this week their first page will still not look exactly as outlined in the wireframe. It is also critical that
          students have completed the assignment from last week before attempting this one... they build off each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W04 Quiz: Preparation</h3>
        <li>Students should finished the
          preparation videos and/or reading assignment and quiz at the
          first of the week. This ensures they are ready to jump into the hands-on
          exercises. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W04 Units of Measurement Practice, W04 Block vs Inline Elements, and W04 CSS Selectors Practice</h3>
        <li>Students can practice with CSS units of measurement, block and inline elements, and CSS selectors by adding to the web page they have practiced with in previous weeks by following these links</li>
        <li><a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w04-units-practice.html">CSS Units of Measurement Practice Example</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w04-block-inline-practice.html">Block and Inline Elements Practice Example</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w04-css-selectors-practice.html">CSS Selectors Practice Example</a></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W04 Assignment: Web Challenge</h3>
        <li>
          This is an good exercise for students to use what they have learned completely on their own, without being stepped through the exact code to type. With the challenge they will be given an example of a finished web page (as an image) and they try to recreate
          it using what they know and
          maybe even a little that they might have to look up or research on their own. It's OK if they don't get it perfect or if they do it differently than others would have. It's just a way to see if they can challenge themselves and use what they've learned by recreating a simple web page.
        </li>
        <li>Here is the code that created the images they have to work with: <a
            class="inline_disabled" href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w04_ice.html" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w04_ice.html</a>. Don't give them any code, just
          let them try and figure it out on their own with a little guidance if needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W04 Assignment: Backend Developer</h3>
        <li>The Web Backend Developer continues the web career exploration. You can require a report from
          your students if you want.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W04 Assignment: Adding More HTML and CSS</h3>
        <li>Students will add a CSS file for their rafting pages this week. Remind students to read carefully. They will not be given all the code in these steps, but they must come up with some code on their own. They may be given small bits of code as examples, but it is not all the code they will create.</li>
        <li>Students will need to validate not only HTML but CSS at <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a> this week. You might want to
          demonstrate this as well.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Remind the students as well that by the end of the week they should have settled on an idea for their
          personal site. Next week they will start planning for that.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course Questions and Conversations Discussion Board.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
