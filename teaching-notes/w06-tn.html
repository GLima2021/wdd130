      <h1>Week 06 - CSS Layout</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week, students will begin learning about CSS layout techniques. Many are introduced, but most of our
          effort will be with CSS Grid.</li>
        <li>This is the last week of Preparation Materials. There will be videos inside assignments to explain things in
          future weeks, but this is the last of our preparation videos and preparation quizzes. Students will begin to
          give all their time, for this course, to their websites; both finishing up the rafting site and starting on
          their personal site project.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week introduces many methods for layout in CSS. However, we will focus most of our efforts on CSS Grid.
        </li>
        <li>Spend a good amount of class time going over examples of setting up a grid and placing items into a grid.
          This can be a very challenging topic for many students.</li>
        <li>The Positioning activity is designed to help the students gain an understanding of Grid primarily...most of
          the problems are easiest to solve with Grid...but if the students solve a problem with another method, give
          them credit. 2 and 5 are the exceptions...2 is easiest with something like Margins, and 5 is only possible
          using a float. The students will need to download the files from the activity link. The code has also been
          included in the instructions in case something happened to the code in a student project.</li>
        <li>This week the students will also be exploring what a SEO Specialist does to wrap up our look at different
          careers related to web.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span>
          <span>&nbsp;Discussion Board.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
