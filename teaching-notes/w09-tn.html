      <h1>Week 09 - Complete the Whitewater Site</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a big week with two large deadlines. The students should complete their Rafting site and their site
          plan for their personal site.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There is an ICE Challenge this week to keep them fresh on grid. <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w09_ice.html">ICE example</li>
        <li>Most of your time this week should be spent responding to questions and helping students solve HTML/CSS
          challenges with their child pages.</li>
        <li>As students begin thinking about how to present their content and creating wireframes, I would introduce
          them to the 'How To' section at <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/</a>. They will have an opportunity to build
          a component like this in Week 12.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
