      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No additional learning activity this week. The students have all the time to finish up their sites and their report. Remind
          them to look at any feedback you have given them and apply it to their site. Remind them also that this final
          project is 40% of their final grade and that they should put a good effort into it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Remind students that it is not just a URL submission, but a submission of a report with the URL included in that report. Refer them to the rubrics for how it will be graded.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
