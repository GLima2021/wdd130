      <h1>Week 07 - Finishing the Home page</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week students will apply the layout skills they learned last week to finish up the Home page for the
          whitewater rafting site.</li>
        <li>Students will also begin a site plan for their personal sites. We will use a new repo in Git and GitHub for
          this. This will also involve a bit of extra attention on the student's part as well, to make sure they get the
          correct URL submitted for each assignment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>During the week the 'Grid Alignment' activity would be a great one to go over in class. There are a few
          alignments they will need for the home page.</li>
        <li>Give the students time in class to work if needed since they have 2 assignments due this week.</li>
        <li>The media query is introduced, but the students can simply copy and past the media query. It might be
          helpful to talk more about media queries in class if they are confused about how it works.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span>
          <span> Discussion Board.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Remind the students of the different type of grading for the new personal site assignments. Many are
          Incomplete/Complete-- all or nothing. This is so they are encouraged to get them all right before going on.
          They can resubmit an Incomplete and have it changed to a Complete if needed.</li>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
