      <h1>Week 03 - Creating the web page</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week the students will write about 90% of the HTML for the home page for the rafting site.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>The Site plan template contains a wireframe that we will be using this week. &nbsp;Stress two things to
          the students: first, the assignment will make much more sense if they refer to the wireframe often while
          reading the instructions, and second their page will <strong>NOT </strong>look like the wireframe at the end
          of this week. We will have all of the content represented there on our page, but it will be weeks before our
          page looks just like the wireframe.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Practice with the student one day in class on how to take a wireframe and make HTML code using the
          wireframe. I would go over all 5 steps in the W03 - Working with Wireframes activity. You will be using the
          wireframe from <a class="inline_disabled"

      <ul>
        <li>The 'Troubleshooting with Validation' is a good exercise to do during class as well so the students can help
          each other or you can do it together.</li>
        <li>The Web Frontend Developer information is something they can do on their own. You can require a report from
          your students if you want.</li>
        <li>Make sure to stress the importance of completing the Troubleshooting and Wireframe activities as well. They
          are ungraded, but important that they understand.</li>
        <li>Help the students understand constructive versus destructive criticism. The criticism needs to be valid and
          concrete</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span>
          <span>&nbsp;Discussion Board</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
