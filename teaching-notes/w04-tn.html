      <h1>Week 04 - Adding CSS</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may need to invest some extra time assisting students this week as this is the first time that many of
          them will be using CSS.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can have them practice with new CSS concepts this week by doing something together in class. Here is a continuation of last week's page that you can use to  <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w04-css-selectors-practice.html" target="_blank">practice CSS Selectors,</a>
          <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w04-block-inline-practice.html" target="_blank">Block and Inline elements,</a>
          <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/activities/w04-units-practice.html" target="_blank">and Units of Measurements</a>
        </li>
        <li>This week, the students begin styling their homepages with CSS. Remind the students again that at the end of
          this week their first page will still not look exactly as outlined in the wireframe. It is also critical that
          students have completed the assignment from last week before attempting this one... they build off each other.
        </li>
        <li>The Web Backend Developer information is something they can do on their own. You can require a report from
          your students if you want.</li>
        <li>This week, students will be introduced to the first ICE (In Class Exercise) challenge. You can use time in
          class for this ICE challenge.
          With the challenge they will be given an example of a finished web page (as an image) and they try to recreate
          it using what they know and
          maybe even a little that they might have to look up or research on their own. They can work in groups to
          complete the challenge. Here is the code that created the images they have to work with: <a
            class="inline_disabled" href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w04_ice.html" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w04_ice.html</a>. Don't give them any code, just
          let them try and figure it out on their own with a little guidance if needed.</li>
        <li>Students will need to validate not only HTML but CSS at <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a> this week. You might want to
          demonstrate this as well.</li>
        <li>Remind the students as well that by the end of the week they should have settled on an idea for their
          personal site. Next week they will start planning for that.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course Questions and Conversations Discussion Board.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
