      <h1>Week 09: Complete the Whitewater Site</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a big week with two large deadlines. The students should complete their Rafting site and their site
          plan for their personal site.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            Even if some 'Ponder' assignments are not graded, encourage the students to carefully complete them. They will need the skills covered for 'Prove' assignments.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Students have a lot to do this week so they might appreciate some in-class time to work on it.
        </li> 
        <li>Most of your time this week should be spent responding to questions and helping students solve HTML/CSS challenges with their child pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W09: Web Challenge</h3>
        <li>There is a Web Challenge this week to keep them fresh on grid. <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w09_ice.html">Card example</a></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W09 Assignment: Completed Rafting Site Subpage</h3>
        <li>A few things that are great to go over are how to copy the home page HTML to the new rafting subpage and then just take out the main code but leave the header and footer.</li>
        <li>Mention how to use the same CSS file for the new page for efficiency. Since all the header and footer CSS is already in that file, they can just add a comment below all the home page CSS and before the media query to show where the new page CSS will be. Warn them of changing general tags like p, img, h1, and so on in the new page because if might effect their home page. Let them know to make unique class or id's on the new page (like river-grid instead of home-grid) if they want only the new page to be effected.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W09 Assignment: Completed Personal Site Plan</h3>
        <li>As students begin thinking about how to present their content and creating wireframes, introduce
          them to the 'How To' section at <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/</a>. They will have an opportunity to build
          a component like this in Week 12.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
