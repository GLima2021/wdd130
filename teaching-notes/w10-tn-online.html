      <h1>Week 10 - HTML Forms</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The model for the rest of the semester will be the same. A short activity to teach some additional knowledge
          about HTML/CSS, and work on their personal sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>W10 Assignment: HTML Forms</h3>
        <li>Students will follow along with a Mozilla Developer Network tutorial to create a simple form. Then they will follow a few additional steps in the assignment to give the user feedback when the form is submitted.</li>
        <li>You can remind students that actually sending the form data is a back-end process that is beyond the scope of this course, so the form data doesn't actually get sent anywhere.</li>
        <li>Students can add a form to a contactus.html page of their rafting site if they would like to. It is suggested in Step 01. If they would rather use a form for one of their personal site pages, they can create one there.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W10 Assignment: Careers in Web Design and Development</h3>
        <li>Students will review a salary.com web page on 'Web Development' and reflect on their discoveries.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W10 Assignment: Personal Site HTML</h3>
        <li>This week, the students are asked to write all the HTML for their personal site. This should hopefully require less
          of your time allowing you to get through the grading from last week.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
