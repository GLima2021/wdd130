      <h1>Week 10 - HTML Forms</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The model for the rest of the semester will be the same. A short activity to teach some additional knowledge
          about HTML/CSS, and work on their personal sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the pages required for the personal site is a form. &nbsp;You may need to follow the article on forms
          up with a few additional examples.</li>
        <li>This week, the students are asked to write the HTML for their home page. This should hopefully require less
          of your time allowing you to get through the grading from last week.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
