      <h1>Week 05 - More CSS</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week, students will continue learning HTML and CSS by looking at font properties and spacing.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;They should have completed the preparation material and preparation quiz before the first day of
          class.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The students should refer back to their site plans to remember which fonts they had chosen. The activity
          will refer back to fonts and other font properties introduced in week 2.</li>
        <li>This week the students will also be asked to begin planning for their personal site. They should have chosen a topic and this week will prepare an elevator statement 'selling' their idea.</li>
        <li>Take class time to code together with the class covering concepts they will see in this week's assignment:
          fonts, box-model (padding, border, and margin). Use the browser developer tools with them during this coding.
        </li>
        <li>Also, let the students take class time to complete this week's ICE challenge. Here is the actual <a
            class="inline_disabled" href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/ice/w05_ice.html" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">HTML file</a> for your reference. They should try and complete it by just recreating the page
          from the image.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course Questions and Conversations Discussion Board.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
