        <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students will have a preparation quiz in the Intro Week. Usually
            this would be done before the first day of class, but this week they
            will complete it before the second day of class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preparation Quiz results. &nbsp;The students must score 100% on the
            Preparation quiz to move on. This is to encourage them to spend the
            time needed to really learn those terms. They can take it as many
            times as they need. &nbsp;This will be the same next week with the
            preparation quiz.
          </li>
          <li>
            Canvas might be a new experience for many students. You may want to
            lead them through a quick tour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remind students to plan their time so that they can work
            consistently on the course throughout the week.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many students are fresh out of high school; make the expectations
            and standards clear to the students.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Install Visual Studio Code and some extensions in class with the
            students. Here are some videos to guide you through the process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Make sure students actually set up the aboutme folder with an
              index.html started, an images folder, a styles folder, and a
              main.css inside of the styles folder. This is demonstrated on the
              video.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Take some time during class to build a simple page together so they
            feel comfortable with the 'Getting to Know You' assignment.&nbsp;
          </li>

        <h2>Assessments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students will create their first html page all about them and place
            it on a discussion board this week for you and the other students to
            see.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>[Note]&nbsp;</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Remind students that they will have a reading assignment and quiz to
            take before the first class of the week next week. The videos and/or
            reading is in the Prepare section of each week.
