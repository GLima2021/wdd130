          <h3>W01 Quiz: Preparation</h3>
          <li>
            Students will have a preparation quiz in the Intro Week. In future weeks
            this would be done before any other assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The students should complete the quiz before the any other assignment each week. The due date and time should be set for the beginning of the week. This is to encourage them to spend the
            time needed to really learn those terms. They can take it as many
            times as they need. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Canvas might be a new experience for many students. You may want to
            lead them through a quick tour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remind students to plan their time so that they can work

            Many students are fresh out of high school; make the expectations
