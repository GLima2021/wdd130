      <h1>Week 08 - Creating Wireframes</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week will be very design-focused. The students should have chosen a child page that they would like to
          complete for the Rafting Site. This week they will apply basic design principles by producing a wireframe for
          that page.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Students get confused that they are creating a wireframe for the rafting site and not the personal site.
          Make sure they know that the wireframe they create this week is for the second page of the rafting site, not
          the personal site.</li>
        <li>Students will continue working on their personal site plans as well. They will be gathering content for
          their personal site.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Remind students to begin their wireframe by adding all of the elements that should remain consistent between
          pages of the same site...i.e. header, navigation, and footer. Then encourage them to look at the provided
          content to help them to know how to design the rest of the pages. The students are free to modify the provided
          content or create their own should they desire.</li>
        <li>You may want to take class time to demonstrate how to make a wireframe and get a screenshot of it using
          gomockingbird.com or wireframes.cc.</li>
        <li>Encourage the students to take the content creation activity for their personal sites seriously. It is
          really hard to design and create a site with no content!</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course Questions and Conversations Discussion Board.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
