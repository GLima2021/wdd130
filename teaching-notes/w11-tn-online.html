      <h1>Week 11 - Layout revisited</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The model for the rest of the semester will be the same. A short activity to teach some additional knowledge
          about HTML/CSS, and working on the personal sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We come back and spend more time on layout this week. The focus is to get the students to understand layout,
          both with Grid and without.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>This week the students are asked to write the CSS for their home page. This will most likely generate a lot
          more questions than last week.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
