      <h1>Week 12: Details</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The model for the rest of the semester will be the same. A short activity to teach some additional knowledge
          about HTML and CSS, and working on the personal sites.</li>
          <li>
            Even if some 'Ponder' assignments are not graded, encourage the students to carefully complete them. They will need the skills covered for 'Prove' assignments.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>W12 Assignment: A Web Component</h3>
        <li>This week's activity encourages the students to pay closer attention to detail than they might normally do.
          Set expectations early in the week about how exact you will expect their finished components to be. Feel free
          to grade this activity a little harder than normal if it feels right, but let them know if you plan to do
          this.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Students will pick a web component from W3Schools.com to create. They can make a new HTML page just for the component and submit it that way. Or they can use a component in their personal site and submit the personal site page. Either way is fine.</li>  
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W12 Quiz: LDS Online Responsibilities</h3>
        <li>Students simply read the talk by Elder Ballard and answer a one question quiz asking if they read it.</li>
        <li>Students seem to forget to do
          these assignments because they are so involved with their personal site, so try and remind them.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>W12 Assignment: Personal Site Subpage 1</h3>
        <li>This week, the students are asked to complete their first child page. Remind them to pay close attention to
          any feedback you are giving them on the parts of their site that they are completing. They should incorporate
          your suggestions before they turn the completed site in for the final.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
