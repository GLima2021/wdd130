      <h1>Week 12 - Details</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The model for the rest of the semester will be the same. A short activity to teach some additional knowledge
          about HTML/CSS, and working on the personal sites.</li>
        <li>This week's activity encourages the students to pay closer attention to detail than they might normally do.
          Set expectations early in the week about how exact you will expect their finished components to be. Feel free
          to grade this activity a little harder than normal if it feels right...but let them know if you plan to do
          this.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This week, the students are asked to complete their first child page. Remind them to pay close attention to
          any feedback you are giving them on the parts of their site that they are completing. They should incorporate
          your suggestions before they turn the completed site in for the final.</li>
        <li>They do have a component assignment and a talk to read through this week. Students seem to forget to do
          these assignments because they are so involved with their personal site.</li>
        <li>Make sure you are available to students through office hours and make responses within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the Course <span>Questions and Conversations</span><span> Discussion Board.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Review assignments and give feedback as needed.</li>
      </ul>
