      <hr />

      <p>
        Last week, you should have finished styling your Home
        page. This week we will style the first child page.
      </p>

      <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Open the file</h3>
          <p>Open the file for your first subpage.</p>
          <!-- <p>
              Create a new HTML file for your child page. Name it something
              short and that relates to what the page is. Remember to avoid
              spaces and capitals in your name. You may want to then Copy/paste
              the contents of your Home page into this new file, replacing what
              was there. Then remove the Home page specific content (usually the
              contents of <code>main</code>).
            </p> -->

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Child Page Grid</h3>
          <p>
            Open the wireframe for your first child page. We need to build the
            Grid for your layout. From the wireframe, determine how many
            columns and rows you will need. Create those rows and columns with CSS, then
            start placing your elements into the grid cells.
          </p>

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>

        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Spacing and Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            Add padding and margins where appropriate to give your layout the
            right amount of white-space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adjust the alignment of elements as well at this time as needed.
          </p>

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Link it up</h3>
          <p>
            Make sure to update the navigation in both your Home page and the
            child page so that if you select the link on either page, it will
            take you to the other.
          </p>

              Note that this week, only the first child page is expected to be
              complete. You will need to follow the steps above for the second
              child page as well, but it is due with the completed site next
              week.

            then submit the URL to your site in I-Learn. Make sure the URL takes the instructor to your child page that
            is completed.
