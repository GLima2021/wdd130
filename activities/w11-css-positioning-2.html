        In this activity, we will take another look at positioning and layout
        with CSS. Both with Grid and without.

          <h3>Other ways to align</h3>
          <p>
            Earlier in the semester, you were introduced to the concept of
            <kbd>block</kbd> and <kbd>inline</kbd> elements. Blocks flow
            vertically down the page by default, and inline flows horizontally
            across. You were also shown how to align both inline and block
            elements. Let's review that again now.
          </p>
          <div class="callout">
            <p>
              For this part of the activity, your mind might jump to Grid as a
              way to solve this. You could actually do it with Grid, but in
              this case, we want to try something different. You will
              <strong>not</strong> need a Grid for this part.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since we are not using Grid, the alignment properties we studied
              above (justify-items, justify-content, align-items, and
              align-content) <strong>will not</strong> work. They only work
              inside of a Grid!
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Block elements first: block elements take up 100% of the <kbd>width</kbd>
            available to them. So, if we want to align them, we first have to
            set a <kbd>width</kbd> of less than 100% on them. Then we can set the left
            and/or right <kbd>margin</kbd> to <kbd>auto</kbd>. For center, we would set
            <em>both</em> left and right to <kbd>auto</kbd> (<kbd>margin: 0 auto;</kbd>). For right-aligned blocks, we
            would set
            <em>just</em> the left
            <kbd>margin</kbd> to <kbd>auto</kbd> (<kbd>margin-left: auto;</kbd>). Blocks are left
            aligned by default, so we don't have to do anything for that!
          </p>

            You can use
            <a href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EObyVY" target="_blank">this codepen</a>
            to practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a look at the following screenshot to see what we are trying
            to do.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img src="../images/layout2-poem.png" alt="block/inline alignment" />
              <figcaption>Poem alignment example</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>The alignment of the poem can be described like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Block 1 should be left-aligned</li>
            <li>Block 2 should be center-aligned</li>
            <li>Block 3 should be right-aligned</li>
            <li>Block 4 should be center-aligned</li>
            <li>
              The first paragraph in blocks 1,2,3 should be left-aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second paragraph in blocks 1,2,3 should be center-aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
              The third paragraph in blocks 1,2,3 should be right-aligned.
            </li>
            <li>The first paragraph in block 4 should be right-aligned.</li>
            <li>The second paragraph in block 4 should be center-aligned.</li>
            <li>
              The third and fourth paragraphs in block 4 should be left
              -aligned.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            All of our blocks are made of
            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements. Remember that if we want to
            align a block element (sections are block elements), we need to set
            a width, then adjust the margins. Set a <kbd>width</kbd> of <kbd>50%</kbd> on
            all of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then set the alignment of each <kbd>block</kbd> by adjusting the
            margins appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we need to align the paragraphs. We can use the
            <kbd>text-align</kbd> property to align the text inside the
            paragraphs. We set the <kbd>text-align</kbd> property on a block
            like a <code>p</code> or <code>h1</code> for example, and it will
            affect everything <em>inside</em> of that block.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could add a <kbd>class</kbd> to each paragraph and change them
            that way...but that is a lot of extra typing, and there is another
            way. We can take advantage of complex selectors. Specifically, the
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-of-type.asp" target="_blank">:nth-of-type()</a>
            pseudo-selector.
          </p>
          <p>
            <kbd>:nth-of-type()</kbd> counts the number of times a
            particular element is the child of another element. Here is an
            example with paragraphs:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-css">
p:nth-of-type(1) { /* first paragraph */}
p:nth-of-type(2) { /* second paragraph */}
p:nth-of-type(3) { /* third paragraph */}
            </code></pre>
          <p>
            Using those selectors, write the CSS that will format the text
            according to the requirements above. Note that block4 is formatted
            differently than the others. For those paragraphs, we will need to
            be more specific. Target just paragraphs that are in the
            <kbd>.block4</kbd> element.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can use the
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_element.asp" target="_blank">descendant selector</a>
            to do this. (&lt;-- If you don't remember what that is, check out
            the link.)

            Once you get your alignments all right...take a screenshot of the
            poem and submit it to ILearn. This will be the second of two images you submit.
            <strong>Note that you may need to adjust the width of your browser
              window once you are done to get yours to look just like
              mine.</strong>
