      <h1>Personal Site Subpage 2</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Last week you should have gotten the styling for your first subpage done. This week we will style the second
        Child page.
      </p>

      <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Open the file</h3>
          <p>Open the file for your subpage.</p>
          <!-- <p>
              Create a new HTML file for your child page. Name it something
              short and that relates to what the page is. Remember to avoid
              spaces and capitals in your name. You may want to then Copy/paste
              the contents of your Home page into this new file, replacing what
              was there. Then remove the Home page specific content (usually the
              contents of <code>main</code>).
            </p> -->

          <!-- END STEP -->

        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Child Page Grid</h3>
          <p>
            Open the wireframe for your the child page. We need to build the
            Grid for your layout. From the wireframe, determine how many
            columns and rows you will need. Then create those with CSS. Then
            start placing your elements into the grid cells.
          </p>

        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Spacing and Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            Add padding and margins where appropriate to give your layout the
            right amount of white-space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adjust the alignment of elements as well at this time as needed.
          </p>

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Link it up</h3>
          <p>
            Make sure to update the navigation in your Home page, your subpage 1, and this page so that if you click on
            a link on any page, it will
            take you to the other.
          </p>

              Note that this week you are finishing up the second subpage. You have one more week to make any
              adjustments needed for your entire site. Check past feedback for adjustments you may need to make. Next
              week is when the entire site and a report for the site will need to be
              complete.

            then submit the URL to your site in ILearn. Make sure the URL takes the instructor to your second child page
            that is completed.
