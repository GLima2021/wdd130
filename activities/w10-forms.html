              <h3>Prepare a page for the form</h3>
              <p>We need a practice page to put our form on. If you remember, we had a contactus.html page referenced in our rafting site's navigation. It might be fun to actually add that page. I know, you thought we were done with that site. Don't worry we will do all the HTML and CSS here in this activity. </p>
              <p>
                  Create the new file in the wwr repository called contactus.html. Paste the subpage HTML into the new page and delete anything in the <kbd>main</kbd> section of the page, leaving the header, footer, and empty main. Change the title in the <kbd>head</kbd> to something more meaninful like 'Contact Us' or 'Form'. Inside the <kbd>main</kbd> portion of the page is where you will place the form code from the tutorial.

              The Mozilla Developer Network (<a

                target="_blank"
                >MDN</a
              >) is a great resource for learning more about working with the
              Web. To begin learning about forms complete this tutorial

              The <kbd>contactus.html</kbd> is where you will complete the activity above. Also, notice that the tutorial uses embedded CSS. You are welcome to leave it that way (embedded in the head section of the contactus.html), or you can add the CSS to your external CSS file for the site if you'd like (just make sure it's above the media query).

          <h3>Functional Forms</h3>
          <p>
            Our form currently doesn't do anything (or maybe even gives you an
            error) if you submit it. If you would like it to do
            <em>something</em>, we need to add a bit of code to your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before your form, let's add an element to hold a success message
            when the form has been submitted. This element will be empty and
            invisible until the form is submitted...then, we will use some
            Javascript to change it. Add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element
            with an <kbd>id="feedback"</kbd> <strong>above</strong> your form
            element.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-markup">

&lt;div id="feedback"&gt;&lt/div&gt;
            </code></pre>
              <p>
                The exercise had you create a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element
                to hold the styling it wanted for the form. Add the following CSS
                to that below the other styles or in the external CSS if you used one.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">
#feedback {
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    padding: .5em;
    /* make this element invisible until we are ready for it */
    display: none;       
}
.moveDown {
    margin-top: 3em;
}
                    </code></pre>
          <p>
            Finally, <strong>below</strong> the elements in the body (right before the ending body tag), add the following
            code:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;script&gt;
    // get the feedback div element so we can do something with it.
    const feedbackElement = document.getElementById('feedback');
    // get the form so we can read what was entered in it.
    const formElement = document.forms[0];
    // add a 'listener' to wait for a submission of our form. When that happens run the code below.
    formElement.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        // stop the form from doing the default action.
        e.preventDefault();
        // set the contents of our feedback element to a message letting the user know the form was submitted successfully. Notice that we pull the name that was entered in the form to personalize the message!
        feedbackElement.innerHTML = 'Hello '+ formElement.user_name.value +'! Thank you for your message. We will get back with you as soon as possible!';
        // make the feedback element visible.
        feedbackElement.style.display = "block";
        // add a class to move everything down so our message doesn't cover it.
        document.body.classList.toggle('moveDown');
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
                    </code></pre>
              <p>
                If everything is working correctly, you should see a message appear
                at the top of the form upon submission.
              </p>

                  The code above is something we have not seen before. It is
                  Javascript. I added lots of comments if you want to try and
                  understand what is going on. Javascript can be used to make our
                  page more interactive, to change based on user actions, but is
                  quite different from HTML and CSS. Don't worry if it doesn't
                  make sense. The purpose of this class is not to teach
                  Javascript, but I wanted to give you a small introduction...and
                  forms are more fun if they <em>do</em> something!

              <p>
                We have just scratched the surface with forms. The next two steps
                in the MDN tutorial (accessed with the 'Next' button) are also great and will teach you much more
                about the details of working with forms. You do not have to
                complete them, but spend some time reviewing the form elements
                they introduce.
