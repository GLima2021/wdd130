      <p>
        This activity is an opportunity to pull together many of the things
        you have learned this semester by using HTML and CSS to build a
        simple web component. (A component is just a part of a web page that is
        commonly used more than once.)
      </p>
      <p>
        W3schools.com has a 'How To' section that has a large list of lots of different components you can add to your
        web page. Some are simple and some more complex, but all the code is given. You just have to fit it to your page
        and add your own content. Some use JavaScript, which is fine, as long as you copy it over exactly as they have
        it. But there are plenty of components that don't use JS, using only HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some examples of components you can create from the website at: <a target="_blank"

      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
          <h3>Understand the Code</h3>
          <p>
            Choose any component you'd like. It doesn't have to be one of the ones listed above. <strong>You will be
              creating it with your own content, not the content they use in the examples.</strong> It is OK if it is
            the only thing in the body portion of your page. Or you can add it to one of your personal site pages if you
            want to use the component there.</p>
          <p>
            I would suggest leaving the <kbd>class</kbd> and <kbd>id</kbd> names the same as they have it in the example
            code so the CSS and
            JS match up properly with the HTML. But everything between tags (the content) should be your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find the HTML example and copy and paste it. Don't miss any of the code. Look through it carefully to
            understand how it was coded. Add your own content to the code.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block fm">
            <figure>
              <img alt="Media Card example" src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w12/html.png" />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Next find the CSS example and copy and paste it into a CSS file. Again, make sure you copy and paste all the
            code. Also, make sure the CSS and HTML are linked together. You can even add it to the existing CSS you
            might already have on your page.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block fm">
            <figure>
              <img alt="Media Card example" src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w12/css.png" />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Review the CSS rule sets and make sure you understand them. There may be many new properties and values that
            you don't understand. Research them on W3Schools.com if you want to learn more about them. If you left the
            classes and id names the same, the CSS should match up well with the HTML. Make sure any <kbd>class</kbd> or
            <kbd>id</kbd> name is
            not already used in your file to avoid changing other elements that are not part of the component.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your component has JavaScript, add that to the file, like we did with our form activity on week 10. If
            you
            are uncomfortable with JavaScript, just use a component that does not use it. You don't have to understand
            the JS completely to use it with these examples, however.
          </p>
        <li>
          <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
          <h3>Customize it for your page</h3>
          <p>
            There may be more tweaking to do to your code to get it to fit well with your content and your page. This is
            completely normal. Take some time to make it work well. Double-check the code and ask for help if it is not
            working for you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>

        <li>
          <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
          <h3>Upload to ILearn</h3>

          <p>Upload your URL of the page that contains the component to ILearn. Also, place in the submission comments
            what component you used on your page.</p>
