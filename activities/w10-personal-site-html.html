            The personal site must consist of a home page and at least two child pages.
          </li>
          <li>The website must be hosted on the web.</li>
          <li>
            Each page of your website must satisfy the following requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Significant textual content consisting of appropriate content for your audience so
                that
                they can understand the meaning and message of this site.
              </li>
              <li>
                At least one image that relates to the content of the
                page.
              </li>
              <li>Working links to your two child pages.</li>
              <li>Be laid out and styled according to your site plan wireframes.</li>

          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Home Page Wireframe</h3>
          <p>
            Open the wireframe for your Home page first. You may even want to
            print it out and grab a marker and a ruler. We need to visualize
            any groups of content on the page and draw boxes around the
            groups. Each of these boxes should be represented as HTML in our
            page. <code>div</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>,
            <code>nav</code>, etc.
            elements should be used for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file in your folder containing your personal website, for your
            Home page.
          </p>

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Home Page HTML and Content</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have identified any content groups on your wireframe,
            begin at the top left corner and start adding the elements
            necessary, then add the content for the home page.
          </p>
          <p>Add a link to your site plan to the footer of the Home page.</p>

          <!-- END STEP -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Continue for page 2 and 3</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have the Home page done, do the same exercise for pages
            two and three. The header and footer code should be very similar
            if not identical to the Home page. Most of your changes should
            happen in the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should create a new HTML file for each page. Name them with
            something meaningful (but without any spaces or capitalization).
            You may even want to copy and paste the HTML from your
            <kbd>index.html</kbd> file as a starting point for these child
            pages. Just remember that while you will want to keep the code in
            the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> (since it should be the same across
            all three pages), you should clear out the
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element when starting each new child
            page.
