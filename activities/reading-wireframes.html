            <h1>Working with Wireframes</h1>

            <p>Last week you got a look at a <a href="../images/wireframe-grid.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a> while building
                out your site plan. Wireframes are valuable tools in web design. They help visualize what should be on a
                page, and where each piece of content should be in relation to each other. We need to stop however and learn
                a little bit about how to read a wireframe, and how to take a wireframe and convert it into HTML.</p>
            <p>We will <strong>not</strong> be learning to make wireframes at this point. Only use them.</p>
            <ol class="bigSteps">
                <li>
                    <h3>Reading wireframes</h3>
                    <p>First visit <a href="https://fuzzymath.com/blog/how-to-read-a-wireframe/" target="_blank">How to read
                            a wireframe</a> and psend some time looking at the infographic to familiarize yourself with what
                        you can expect to find on a wireframe.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>From Wireframe to Website</h3>
                    <p>Next watch the videos <strong>two</strong> through <strong>five</strong> in this playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfoSnpsDRhTgz6VrVPvYqvR"
                            target="_blank">From Wireframe to Website</a> (~10 minutes). This is a great example of what we need
                        to do with our wireframe this week...convert it into HTML. Pay careful attention to how HTML elements
                        are used in two ways: to display content, and group and show relationships between content.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Practice</h3>
                    <p>Visit this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/978949-Responsive-Wireframe-Templates-GIF/attachments/113429"
                            target="_blank">wireframe example</a> and convert it into HTML. You are welcome to help each other
                        out with this task. You may find the following resources helpful.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://loremflickr.com" target="_blank">LoremFlickr</a>: Placeholder image generator.
                            We need something to use as images for our page. This is a quick and easy way to get some. Usage:
                            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;img src="https://loremflickr.com/320/240?random=1" /&gt;</code> </pre>                            This
                            would give you a random image that was 320px X 240px large. If you want the images to always
                            be different (we need several) change the "1" at the end to a different number for each image.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Important!</h3>
                    <p>Remember that our goal is not to produce a finished version of the example site. It will look much
                        like the site in the videos looked by video five...very rough. We are only trying to make sure we
                        get all of the markup to include all of the content represented in the wireframe. Your finished page
                        <strong>WILL NOT</strong> look like the wireframe.</p>
                </li>
