        <h1>Your personal Site Plan</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Just as we did for the rafting site, before we build our personal
          (final) project we need to do some planning. We started this last week
          by preparing our purpose. This week we will begin a Site plan for the
          personal site we want to build that is very similar to the one we
          prepared for the rafting site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start by creating a new repository for our final
          website. Open up github.com and login if you need to. Click the 'New repository' option from the + drop down in the upper right.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="new repository screen shot">
        <p>
            Give it a name and remember this will be a part of the URL (web address) so keep it short, simple, and professional. The name should also have something to do with the topic of your personal site. Don't use the example in the image below.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can add a description if you'd like and leave the Public radio button selected and check the "Add a README file" checkbox. Then click 'Create respository'
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="create repository screen shot">
        <p>
            You may see a screen like this:
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="beginning repository screen shot">
        <p>
            Click the repo name in the upper left to see what is contained in the repo.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="click repo link screen shot">
        <p>
            Now we need to tell VSCode and our Local Git about our repo. Click on the 'Code' drop down menu button and copy the HTTPS URL. 
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="copy HTTPS URL screen shot">
        <p>Open up VSCode and from the 'View' menu option choose 'Command Palette'. 
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="view menu screen shot">
        <p>Type git clone to bring up the 'Git: Clone' option in blue below it. Click that blue bar with the text 'Git: Clone'</p>
        <p>You will see a place in the text box to paste your HTTPS URL that you copied earlier. Just click inside the textbox where it says "Provide respository URL ..." and paste the URL and hit enter</p>
        <img src="" alt="provide url screen shot">
        <p>
            Your file management window will open and you can choose a location of where you want the repository on your local Git. Choose a location and click 'Select Repository Location'. It will create a folder in that location with the name of your repo and the only file in there right now is the README.md file.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you get a pop-up asking if you want to open the cloned repository you can click 'Open' or just open it as File menu option 'Add Folder to Workspace'. You may also get a "Do you Trust these files" just say 'Yes, I Trust..'. If you get a question about saving you workspace configuration as a file you can just click 'Cancel'. But don't worry if you don't get some of these pop-ups, but do open the new repo folder in VSCode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now VSCode, our local Git and GitHub can all work together just as we've been doing with our rafting site repo. As you add and change files in this folder the changes will be noticed and wait to be committed and pushed to the GitHub repo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a file to your new repo called site-plan.html. 
        </p>
        <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/site-plan-personal.html"
            target="_blank">Site Plan Template</a> Right-click on the page and view the source code. (On Chrome it's
          the pop-up menu option 'View Page Source')</p>
        <p>
            Copy <strong>all</strong> the html code. You can use Cmd+A or Ctrl+A to select it all quickly, then copy it.</p>
        <p>
            Paste the code into your site-plan.html page in VSCode and save the file.</p>
        <p>
          As you look at the new site plan template you will notice it is very
          similar to the last one. It does have a new section however...Content.
          For the Dry Oar site I provided you with content, you will need to
          generate all of the content (text and media) for your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also be required to create three wireframes. One for each
          page in your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will have some activities designed to help you complete your site
          plan...but much of it you will need to do on your own. The completed
          site plan for your personal site is due at the end of
          <strong>Week 9</strong>. This gives you three weeks to complete it.
          <strong>Don't wait until the beginning of Week 9 to start!</strong>!
        </p>
