      <h1>Your Personal Site Plan</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Just as we did for the rafting site, before we build our personal
        (final) project, we need to do some planning. We started this last week
        by preparing our purpose with the elevator pitch. This week we will begin a Site plan for the
        personal site we want to build that is very similar to the one we
        prepared for the rafting site.
      </p>
      <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Create a new repo for your new site</h3>
          <p>
            Let's start by creating a new repository for our final
            website. Open up github.com and login to the same account we used for the rafting site if you're not already
            logged in. Click the 'New repository' option from the + drop down in the upper right.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_repository.png" alt="new repository screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>
            Give it a name and remember this will be a part of the URL (web address), so keep it short, simple, and
            professional. The name should also have something to do with the topic of your personal site. Don't use the
            example in the image below.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can add a description, if you'd like, and leave the Public radio button selected and check the "Add a
            README file" checkbox. Then click 'Create respository'
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/create_repository.png"
              alt="create repository screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>
            You may see a screen like this:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/beginning_repo.png"
              alt="beginning repository screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>
            Click the repo name in the upper left to see what is contained in the repo.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/repo_link.png" alt="click repo link screen shot">
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Link VSCode and Git to GitHub repo</h3>
          <p>
            Now we need to tell VSCode and our Local Git about our repo. Click on the 'Code' drop down menu button and
            copy the HTTPS URL.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/copy_url.png" alt="copy HTTPS URL screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Open up VSCode and from the 'View' menu option choose 'Command Palette'.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/view_menu.png" alt="view menu screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Type git clone to bring up the 'Git: Clone' option in blue below it. Click that blue bar with the text
            'Git: Clone'</p>
          <p>You will see a place in the text box to paste your HTTPS URL that you copied earlier. Just click inside the
            textbox where it says "Provide respository URL ..." and paste the URL and hit enter</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/provide_url.png" alt="provide url screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>
            Your file management window will open, and you can choose a location of where you want the repository on
            your local Git. Choose a location and click 'Select Repository Location'. It will create a folder in that
            location with the name of your repo and the only file in there right now is the README.md file.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you get a pop-up asking if you want to open the cloned repository, you can click 'Add to Workspace' or
            just open it as File menu option 'Add Folder to Workspace'. You may also get a "Do you Trust these files"
            just say 'Yes, I Trust..'. If you get a question about saving you workspace configuration as a file you can
            just click 'Cancel'. But don't worry if you don't get some of these pop-ups, but do open the new repo folder
            in VSCode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now VSCode, our local Git, and GitHub can all work together just as we've been doing with our rafting site
            repo. As you add and change files in this folder, the changes will be noticed and wait to be committed and
            pushed to the GitHub repo.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Add Site Plan Files</h3>
          <p>
            Add a file to your new repo called <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_file.png"
              alt="new site-plan.html file screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/site-plan-personal.html"
              target="_blank">Site Plan Template</a>, right-click on the page, and view the source code. (On Chrome it's
            the pop-up menu option 'View Page Source'.)</p>
          <p>
            Copy <strong>all</strong> the HTML code. You can use Cmd+A or Ctrl+A to select it all quickly, then copy it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paste the code into your <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> page in VSCode and save the file.</p>
          <p>Create a new 'styles' folder. And create a <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file inside that folder.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_css.png"
              alt="new style folder and file screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>Go to: <a href="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/site-plan-templates/styles/site-plan.css"
              target="_blank">Site Plan CSS</a> and copy <strong>all</strong> the code.</p>
          <p>Paste the code into the <kbd>site-plan-rafting.css</kbd> file in VSCode and save it.</p>
          <p>
            As you look at the new site plan template, you will notice it is very
            similar to the last one. It does have a new section, however...Content.
            For the rafting site, you were provided with content, but you will need to
            generate all of the content (text and media) for your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also be required to create three wireframes. One for each
            page of your site. Creating wireframes will be covered at a later time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will have some activities designed to help you complete your site
            plan...but much of it you will need to do on your own. The completed
            site plan for your personal site is due at the end of
            <strong>Week 9</strong>. This gives you three weeks to complete it.
            <strong>Don't wait until the beginning of Week 9 to start!!</strong>

                <li>
                  <em>At least</em> one image that relates to the content of the

          <h3>Purpose and Audience</h3>
          <p>
            Place your elevator pitch from last week into the Purpose section
            and write 75-100 words about your intended audience.

            Choose a color scheme and one or more Fonts that you think will
            work well and enter the information into the plan's HTML and CSS.

          <h3>Make the GitHub Repo Live on GitHub Pages</h3>
          <p>
            To see the new Site Plan live on the internet as a webpage, we need to set up GitHub Pages like we did with
            our rafting site.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in GitHub with your new repo open, click the 'Settings' tab.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/settings.png" alt="copy HTTPS URL screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>
            Scroll down until you see the 'GitHub Pages' section and click on the "Check it out here!" link.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/pages.png" alt="copy HTTPS URL screen shot">
          </figure>
          <p>
            Under Source select the Main branch and click save.

          </figure>
          <p>
            You should now see a blue rectangle with the live URL you need for that repo. You can click that link and it
            will go to your new repo.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Remember, we don't have an <kbd>index.html</kbd> or home page yet. So you have to type in the
            <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> at the end
            of the URL web address and hit enter to get it to open.
