        <strong>This week we only need to finish the planning for the personal

      <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Create the Home wireframe</h3>
          <p>
            If you have completed the previous personal site plan assignments, you should only have the 3 wireframes to
            complete for each of your pages. Review the content you prepared last week for each page
            that you are planning to build, then start with the Home page.
            Make sure you account for each block of content in your plan. Pay
            special attention to the header and footer, as these should be on
            each page. Keep in mind as well the principles of good design.
          </p>


          <!-- END STEP  -->
        </li>


        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Create the other wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            Create two more wireframes for the subpages. Use the same header and footer design as the home page for each
            of these pages.
          </p>

          <!-- END STEP  -->
        </li>

        <li>
          <!-- START STEP -->
          <h3>Verify</h3>
          <p>
            An image of each wireframe should be placed in the wireframe section of your personal site plan.
            Review each section of your site plan. Make sure that each is
            complete and free of spelling and grammar errors. Then submit the URL of your personal site plan to Ilearn.
