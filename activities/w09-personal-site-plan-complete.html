        <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Create the Home wireframe</h3>
            <p>
              If you have completed previous personal site plan assignments, you should only have the 3 wireframes left to complete for each of your pages. Review the content you prepared last week for each page
              that you are planning to build, then start with the Home page.
              Make sure you account for each block of content in your plan. Pay
              special attention to the header and footer as these should be on
              each page. Keep in mind as well the principles of good design.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Create the other wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Using your Home wireframe as a starting point (remember that the
              header and footer should be the same across all three pages)
              create wireframes for your two child pages. Add all three
              wireframe images to the Site plan.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP  -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Verify</h3>
            <p>
              Review each section of your site plan. Make sure that each is
              complete and free of spelling and grammar errors. Then submit the URL of your personal site plan to Ilearn.
            </p>
