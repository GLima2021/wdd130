            <p>One of the goals of this course is to introduce you to many of the different career options available in
                Web
                Design and Development. We learned about Frontend developers last week. Now we will learn about Backend
                Development.</p>
            <p>Watch this introduction to this career by Treehouse. It introduces the type of work you would be doing,
                along with the skills you would need to succeed. It will also review many of the concepts we have
                already
                been learning in the course.</p>
