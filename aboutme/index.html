    <h2>Gabriel Lima S Santos</h2>


    <p>Hello, I'm Gabriel Lima Santos, a 26-year-old from the beautiful state of Pernambuco, Brazil.</p>
    <p>My journey has been shaped by faith, and I answered a calling to serve as a missionary first. This journey
        eventually led me to higher education at BYU Idaho.</p>
    <p>After completing my mission in Ghana, Africa, where I learned, connected with the community, and served
        wholeheartedly, I returned to Brazil. There, I embraced new adventures, including marriage to a beautiful wife
        who shares my passion for service and our shared decision to adopt a lovely pet dog named Maggie.</p>
    <p>Now, as a dedicated student, I have a vision to use my education, faith, and mission experiences to make a
        positive impact on the world, bridging cultural gaps and building connections among diverse communities.</p>
    <p>My journey is a testament to the power of faith, education, and service, and I look forward to the next chapters
        of life with my family and furry companion by my side.</p>
